In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with object ownership and memory management using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *someString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    self.someString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"];
    // ... some code ...
}
@end
```

This code appears innocuous; however, if `someMethod` is called multiple times or if there's no mechanism to release `someString` when it's no longer needed, memory leaks can occur. While ARC handles many memory management details, developers must still be mindful of retain cycles and proper object lifecycles.  The `strong` keyword holds a strong reference to `someString`; releasing this manually (or ensuring it's released naturally in the object's dealloc method) is crucial to prevent leaks.
